["install.html", "2 Installing R 2.1 Install R 2.2 Install R Studio 2.3 Using the Cloud 2.4 Install R and R Studio - Video Instruction", " 2 Installing R To use R on your own PC or laptop, you will need to install two things: R (the programming language) R Studio (a software that makes R easier to run) You can also access R Studio online which can be great if you have a good internet connection, or are on a computer that you don’t have admin rights to. Important: If you want to use R and R Studio on your own device you need to install both. If you prefer watching instructions you can watch the installation videos below. 2.1 Install R R is the programming language we will use. It is freely available, meaning you do not need to pay for R. To install R, you will need to navigate to (or click the link to) the Comprehensive R Archive Network - cran. While there, you want to download R for your operating system (most likely Windows or Mac). Click the link that names your operating system and look for the instructions that say install R for the first time. There will be a link that says something like Download R 4.0.2 for Windows. (The exact version number is not really important yet). After you have installed R, you can check to see if it works, or go straight to installing R Studio 2.2 Install R Studio R Studio is a tool that helps make R more user friendly. It also lets you collect all your data files into ‘projects’. This is very useful for managing your projects and ‘workflows’ (more on that here). 2.3 Using the Cloud If you would like to use R Studio Cloud, you will need to create an R Studio account. This can be a whole new account, a google account, or a github account. I would recommend you get a github account (you can jump to read why here). After you have logged in, you can access a workspace. A workspace is like an R Studio Project. As of the 3rd August, 2020, R Studio Cloud is moving out of Beta and will be available to all. You should use the Cloud Free Plan. Again, we do not expect you to buy anything to use R or R Studio. You will have a maximum of 15 projects you can use, and less storage space than using your own device. 2.4 Install R and R Studio - Video Instruction If you prefer to get your resources in video format, there’s an explanation of installing R and R Studio here and using R Studio Cloud here. Please note, these videos are a bit older now so you should expect to see some minor differences, e.g. in version numbers. "],
["starthere.html", "3 Getting Started 3.1 The Big Secret", " 3 Getting Started 3.1 The Big Secret It took me about ten years of working in R to get over my fear of copying and pasting other peoples’ code. There are some great power users of R who are able to pull R code out of nowhere. The rest of us look it up, copy and paste, and modify. That is perfectly normal and acceptable behaviour. 3.1.1 Exercise Watch Tidy Tuesday video "],
