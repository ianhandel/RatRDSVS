## Data Vis {#datavis}

Data visualisation is one of the most important skills a scientst can learn, and being able to identify good and bad data visualisation will make you the life and soul of every party, and incredibly popular at all times.

In this chapter, we're not going to look at any R code. Instead we're going to think about what data visualisation means. 


### When charts go bad {#vis_bad}

Lets take a look at **Figure 4.1**. 

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.width = 4, fig.cap="US State of Georgia, COVID-19 Deaths,\nSource: https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2020/05/18/1589795135000/When-axes-get-truly-evil/", fig.align = 'center'}

knitr::include_graphics("images/04_datavis/georgia_covid.jpg")

```

There is an [excellents article](https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2020/05/18/1589795135000/When-axes-get-truly-evil/) from the Financial Times about this chart. I think this chart is a great example of why data visualisation is important. 

We use charts to communicate large amounts of data quickly and easily.

Often, in life, we are trying to communicate something important. We are often trying to persuade someone to do something, like give us more research money, or to make a change that we want to see. 

What message do you think **Figure 4.1** is trying to communicate? 

If you look at the x axis (the one that goes across the graph), what order are the dates in?


### Chart anatomy {#vis_anatomy}
#### The two-axes rule
Most charts will have two axes:

  * The **x axis** which goes **across the chart**
  
  * The **y axis** which goes **up the chart** (upp-**y**/down-**y** was how I used to remember it).
  

As in data science we are often interested in **does x affect y**, we usually put the **explanatory** variable on the x axis. We try to always have the thing that drives variation going across the chart, whereas the thing that responds to variation goes up and down the chart. (The response-**y** variable.)

You should always thing about your axes - and they should be clear to the reader from the beginning. No messing with the order (see again **Figure 4.1**).

Unless you have a very good reason, I would always have two axes. That means if you're trying to put in a second Y axis, you are breaking the two-axes rule, and should re-evaluate your chart. If you're trying to make a pie-chart, you are breaking the two-axes rule, and should re-evaluate your chart. 

Follow the two-axes rule, and your life will be a lot easier. 

#### Why I hate pie charts
Pie charts are the worst visualisation in the world. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.cap="The worst kind of chart describing proportion of people with type of pet (fictional data)"}

pie_df <- data.frame(group = c("Cats", "Dogs", "Fish", "Birds", "Reptiles", "Rabbits"),
                     values = c(25,28, 20, 15 ,2,10))

pie_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = "", y= values, fill = group)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0)

```

Let's take **Figure 4.2** as an example. What proportion of people have a dog versus a cat. I'll wait for you to start puzzling through that question. 

If we put labels on the chart stating the value, why would we not just put data in a 



```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message= FALSE, fig.cap = "A much better chart describing proportion of people with type of pet (fictional data)"}


pie_df %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = group, y= values, fill = group)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity", position = position_dodge2()) +
  labs(y = "N of People With Pet")

```


#### Figure headings


#### Legends


#### Colours
The use of colours in charts is a curious thing. Colour can be very useful in a chart, but also very distracting. There's another [brilliant FT article on the use of colour to indicate gender in charts](https://www.ft.com/content/c4b7d8be-2eb0-11e8-9b4b-bc4b9f08f381) and all the ensuing complications. 


##### Advanced R users
If you have gotten really into R, or you really like pretty colours, I highly recommend checking out [Emil Hvitfeldt's well maintained repository](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/r-color-palettes) listing all the R colour palette packages out there. Personally I really like `nord`^[I like `nord` so much its the colour scheme for this book] and `LaCroixColoR` and `NineteenEightyR`. Much of my life is spent tweaking colours on charts.



### Bar charts {#vis_bar}



### Histograms {#vis_hist}


### Scatterplots {#vis_scatter}


### Boxpots {#vis_box}





### Infographics {#vis_infographic}

In our increasingly connected world, we are seeing more and more infographics. As they're less standardised, there can be more room for interpretation. For example;
