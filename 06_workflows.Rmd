## Workflows {#workflows}
Throughout this book, I have been talking about the importance of repeatable workflows. 

In this chapter, you will work through a R Markdown document, run code, and adapt code within the document. 





## Editing R Markdown Docs  {#editrmd}

Open your R Markdown file in R Studio by navigating to `File > Open File` and navigating to the folder you have saved the .rmd file to. Remember it will be easier if you save this in the folder your R Project file is in.
